    aboutme: "Since 2018, I've been working at the intersection of data analysis and software development. As a Data Engineer, I combine both worlds to extract valuable insights from data. My professional journey began as a Working Student at OTTO and led me through various roles within the company, eventually advancing to Analytics & Technology Manager and later to Data Engineer. Before OTTO, I gained valuable experience at Hewlett Packard Enterprise, starting with a Dual Study Program and later working as an Account Manager. Now at Beiersdorf AG, I continue to develop and optimize complex data pipelines. I'm particularly fascinated by the challenge of finding technical solutions that are both efficient and user-friendly. Outside the data world, you can find me sailing on the water or figuring out strategic moves - whether in digital games or analog board games.",
